# single-page-app_assignment

**Description:** In this assignment, we worked alongside a video to create a single-page app. Then we were tasked with making improvements.  I made the following improvemnts:
1. Moved all links that were originally in the body of the index.HTML file to the nav bar.
2. Aligned the links in navbar to the individual pages
3. Originally there was a footer on the blog and pricing pages. I added the same header to the home and signin pages.
4. Made formatting changes to the navbar.

**Instructions on how to run the app:**
To run this app you, download all the HTML files in the repository and save them locally. Then use node to run whatever local host you have set up.

**Roadmap for future improvements:**

1. Refactor this code to a React app, and create a React component for each section of the page: header, footer, home, pricing, blog, & signin.
